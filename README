Contract Rummy is a game my family knows through the ranks and was taught to us all by my Grandmother. I have a deep love for this game (or rather this verison of this game). My Girlfriend also has started playing more regularly and we enjoy playing Contract Rummy togeather.

We have one problem however. We currently live over 200 miles away. While we visit each other almost every weekend our desire to play Contract Rummy has stemmed to almost a nightly basis.

The result is this attempt to create a web based Contract Rummy system.

About Contract Rummy

I've never actually looked but there is apparently a lot of versions of Rummy. Even worse I came across and "official rules" document and found that the version of Contract Rummy differs in a few key areas. I don't see how this is possible as both my Grandmothers know how to play this version of Contract and both have never met.

In this version of Contract Rummy you play with a double deck (removing the Jokers) and each player starts with seven cards. There are two notions of card groups. There is a "Set" and a "Run"

A Set is a group consisting of three or more same value cards (IE: 3 Jacks, 3 Sevens, etc)

A Run is a group consisting of four of more consecutive same-suit cards. Think of it as a "Straight Flush" from poker, only it's four (or more).
